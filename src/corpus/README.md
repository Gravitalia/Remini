# Remini/corpus ðŸ‘¤
> Corpus detects whether it's a "nude" or a "not nude" using the magic of machine learning.

# Name historic
Corpus is not derived from a philosophical concept like most other AIs, but from the word "**corps**" from the Latin "_corpus_", which today means: a collection of works.

In addition to the beauty of the body exposed by the nude images, the French meaning plays a part in the very development of any "AI" (machine learning model): datasets. Datasets are a collection of data - in our case, heterogeneous data - represented by the corpus.

This name is striking for its polysemy, which represents development and its purpose: the body.
