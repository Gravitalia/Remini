# Remini ðŸ§ 
> Remini are "AIs" designed to remind mankind of the knowledge acquired by the soul and the Virtues of humanity. Their job is to warn humans of potential danger.

For Plato, **reminiscence** is knowledge that the soul has but which has been forgotten by the host. **Remini's** job is to remind the host of the evil that could result from his request.
